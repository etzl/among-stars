# Among Stars ðŸ‘¾

Inspired by old-school arcade games and my room's persian carpet

If you look closely you can find the enemies.

## How to play

You can move around and submit/shoot with `<ARROW_KEYS>` and `<ENTER>` respectively.

There's also a **Help** button in the menu which explains the game.

### Command Line Arguments

`--no-menu` Go directly to the game (without showing menu)  
`--no-damage`   Die hard - sets the player health to [maximum possible value](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/numeric_limits/max)  
`--help`    Show help and quit

### Score & Health

Player's stats is shown on the top-right corner:

![stats picture](/docs/stats.png)

Short for 'Health Point' and 'Kill Point'

## Compiling

There's **no need to install** the game. It can be compiled and run in the same directory.

After installing the dependencies, run:

```bash
make
make run or ./among_stars
```

### Dependencies

- GNU compiler that supports *C++17* or higher (version 9 or later)
- development ncurses library

Packages on Debian (bullseye): `libncurses-dev` and `libncurses6`  
This is probably the same on recent Debian distros and Debian derivatives (like Ubuntu 20.04 or higher).

### Building on windows

See #18

The best and easiest way is probably using *WSL* as a first option, and then *Cygwin* (because the first one has microsoft support, and my own personal experience)

As for building directly, I currently doesn't support it and I need more investigation. But feel free to open a PR to support it on windows, you can read what I've found in the issue mentioned above.

## Documentation

You can look through [wikis](https://github.com/etzl/among-stars/wiki) for technical details, and more detailed description, to help you understand the code.
