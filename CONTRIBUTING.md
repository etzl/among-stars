# How To Contribute

If you want to add a feature first open an issue so we can talk about it.  
Other than that feel free to tackle one of the issues.

## Branching Model

The project uses [Driessen's branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

Basically, make your own branch, make your changes, and then open a PR to `develop` branch.
